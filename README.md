## General info
### How this works?
Advisor+ is purely crows sourced. You can either register as a user, or if you are a professional at any field, you can register as an expert. By registering as a user, you can ask any question related to any field, be it sports, science, psychology, arts etc. 

After that, registered expert in the relevant field may answer your question. The user can then rate the answer, which also increases the rating of the expert, and the post is blogged in the Advisor+ page. 

If a user like to keep it private, anonymous question facility is available and none of your data will be stored. 

### Why Advisor+ ?
Yes, there are many question-answer platforms in the market. But what makes Advisor+ unique is that only registered professional in the relevant field can answer the questions. So, the chance to get spam and misleading answers are at the lowest. 

Another perk of being an expert on Advisor+ is that more you answer, your rating grows. Of course, the rating is added by the users and this can be used as your professional qualitification. At the same time, all your answers are blogged in Advisor+ itself. 

### Use without registering

If you don't want to register on any category, still you can refer the blogs which answered the user's questions. As the answered are provided by professionals, you can use our blogs for research activities, articles etc.
